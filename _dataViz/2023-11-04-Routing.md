Application to optimize the route of surveillance vehicles on [OSM](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) data.

# Intro

[MGSurvE](../research/2021-11-15-MGSurvE.html), our newest research software, optimizes placement of traps to minimize the time it'd take for mosquitoes to fall into them. This, however, doesn't take into account the cost that checking upon those traps would impose on surveillance programs. To combine these costs, I started working on an extension that would mix data from [OSMnx](https://osmnx.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), with the locations of our traps, and make the use of [OR-tools](https://developers.google.com/optimization) to optimize the positioning of the surveillance devices with the vehicle routing.

In this post I will go through some of the initial work that has be laid towards integrating this information to the optimization cycle. Namely, the way we can use traffic networks information combined with or-tools to do vehicle routing.

# Code Dev

The development of this code is divided into four parts: [downloading the required data](#downloading-data), [calculating the distances matrix](#road-distance-matrix), [running the optimization routine](#route-optimization), and [generating our map](#visualizing-routes).

## Downloading Data

In this application, we will use [OSMnx](https://osmnx.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html) to download the geo-spatial data from [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org), so we need to install it in our system (easiest way to get it running is to install it through [anaconda](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/osmnx)). Once it's correctly installed, we can load it in our script and set it up as follows:

```python
import osmnx as ox
ox.settings.log_console=False
ox.settings.use_cache=True
```

### Buildings Footprints

Even though it's not strictly needed for routes optimization, we will download the buildings data for plotting (and for its use in [MGSurvE](../research/2021-11-15-MGSurvE.html)):

```python
(COORDS, DIST) = ((-2.5195,32.9046), 5000)
BLD = ox.geometries.geometries_from_point(
    COORDS, dist=DIST, tags={'building': True}
)
BLD['centroid_lon'] = [poly.centroid.x for poly in BLD['geometry']]
BLD['centroid_lat'] = [poly.centroid.y for poly in BLD['geometry']]
BLD.reset_index(inplace=True)
```

This function will center the map in the provided coordinates `COORDS` and return the footprints that fit in a bounding box from the provided distance `DIST` above ground. We are adding the centroid of the footprint polygons as it is sometimes useful for applications such as clustering and aggregation.

### Traffic Networks

Next, we'll download the traffic network information:

```python
NTW = ox.graph_from_point(
    COORDS, dist=DIST, 
    network_type='drive',
    retain_all=False, simplify=True, 
    truncate_by_edge=False
)
```

Which does the same but for the traffic network. It's worth noting that this function can also take other different types of networks `{"all_private", "all", "bike", "drive", "drive_service", "walk"}` as described in its [documentation](https://osmnx.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-reference.html#module-osmnx.graph).

### Water Bodies

Another one that we will download mostly for plotting purposes. We can download the water data with:

```python
WTR = ox.geometries.geometries_from_point(
    COORDS, dist=DIST, 
    tags={"natural": "water"}
)
```

## Road-Distance Matrix

[OR-tools](https://developers.google.com/optimization) uses a distance matrix to calculate an optimum route between the points in a network. This could be done with the [Euclidean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance) or [Vincenty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincenty%27s_formulae) distance between the nodes, but that would disregard the driving between locations. We will use [NetworkX's](https://networkx.org/) `shortest_path_length` [function](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/algorithms/generated/networkx.algorithms.shortest_paths.generic.shortest_path_length.html) to calculate the distance between points on our [OSMnx](https://osmnx.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) road network object.

### Projecting Network

The roads network needs to be projected to a coordinate system. For our work and visualizations we will use [cartopy](https://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/latest/) and its reference system. Additionally, as this network is directed, there might be pair of nodes that are not connected to one another, which could cause problems in our distances matrix. To avoid this, we will be using only the [strongly connected network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strongly_connected_component), which makes sure that there is a way to traverse any pair of nodes in the system:

```python
import cartopy.crs as ccrs
PROJ = ccrs.PlateCarree()

G = ox.project_graph(NTW, to_crs=PROJ)
G = ox.utils_graph.get_largest_component(G, strongly=True)
```

### Distance Matrix

We now need to calculate the distance between all the surveillance points in the map `(ptsX, ptsY)`. We do this by obtaining the closest road `node` and tracing the shortest route to all the pairwise combinations of nodes:

```python
nNodes = ox.nearest_nodes(G, ptsX, ptsY)
dMat = routeDistancesMatrix(G, nNodes)
```

The auxiliary function to generate the distances matrix `dMat` is:

```python 
def routeDistancesMatrix(G, nNodes, weight='length'):
    TRPS_NUM = len(nNodes)
    dMatrix = np.zeros((TRPS_NUM, TRPS_NUM), dtype=float)
    for row in range(TRPS_NUM):
        cnode = nNodes[row]
        for col in range(TRPS_NUM):
            tnode = nNodes[col]
            dMatrix[row, col] = nx.shortest_path_length(
                G=G, 
                source=cnode, target=tnode, 
                weight=weight
            )
    return dMatrix
```

## Route Optimization

Time to put this all together into the routing routine and solve it. I am by no means an expert on the [OR-tools](https://developers.google.com/) framework so I will broadly describe the process but I invite the reader to look at their [documentation and examples](https://developers.google.com/optimization/routing) for more information.

### Setup

For this example we will setup one of our locations as the depot, and have two vehicles do the surveillance of the locations. [OR-tools](https://developers.google.com/optimization) takes a dictionary with this information, so we set it up as follows:

```python
data = {}
data["distance_matrix"] = dMat.astype(int)
data["num_vehicles"] = 2
data["depot"] = 40
```

and register it to the solver manager as follows:

```python
manager = pywrapcp.RoutingIndexManager(
    len(data["distance_matrix"]), 
    data["num_vehicles"], 
    data["depot"]
)
```

<center><img width="100%" src="/media/routing/routes02.png"></center>

We now define our `distance_callback` function, which returns the route distance between nodes to the solver. Additionally, we define the `ArcCost` which, in this case, is the same route distance, as we are not taking into account any additional costs for the time being (see the [documentation](https://developers.google.com/optimization/routing/tsp#create_the_distance_callback) for more information).

```python
routing = pywrapcp.RoutingModel(manager)
def distance_callback(from_index, to_index):
    from_node = manager.IndexToNode(from_index)
    to_node = manager.IndexToNode(to_index)
    return data["distance_matrix"][from_node][to_node]
transitCallbackIx = routing.RegisterTransitCallback(distance_callback)
routing.SetArcCostEvaluatorOfAllVehicles(transitCallbackIx)
```

Now, following the [routing example](https://developers.google.com/optimization/routing/vrp), we have to define a `Dimension` so that we add constraints to our problem. In this case, we will add the constraint that vehicles shouldn't drive for more than 100,000 meters:

```python
(slack, maxDistance, cumulZero, dimName) = (0, int(1e5), True, "Distance")
routing.AddDimension(transitCallbackIx, slack, maxDistance, cumulZero, dimName)
distance_dimension = routing.GetDimensionOrDie(dimName)
distance_dimension.SetGlobalSpanCostCoefficient(100)
```

We now need to setup our [heuristic](https://developers.google.com/optimization/routing/routing_options#first_solution_strategy) to find a "good" solution to our problem in a quick way:

```python
search_parameters = pywrapcp.DefaultRoutingSearchParameters()
search_parameters.first_solution_strategy = (
    routing_enums_pb2.FirstSolutionStrategy.PATH_CHEAPEST_ARC
)
```


### Optimization

With everything setup, running our optimizer is pretty simple:

```python
solution = routing.SolveWithParameters(search_parameters)
```

which returns us an object from which we need to extract the routing solution.

### Routing

As we mentioned, we need to tranform our [OR-tools](https://developers.google.com/) solution into routes that we can use and visualize. To do this, the first step is to transform the aforementioned solution and getting the lists of sites as they should be traversed by each vehicle. We can do so by defining the following helper function:

```python
def get_solution(data, manager, routing, solution):
    routes = []
    for vehicle_id in range(data["num_vehicles"]):
        index = routing.Start(vehicle_id)
        route = []
        while not routing.IsEnd(index):
            route.append(manager.IndexToNode(index))
            index = solution.Value(routing.NextVar(index))
        route = route + [route[0]]
        routes.append(route)
    return routes
```

and calling it on our optimization objects:

```python
OSOL = getSolution(data, manager, routing, solution)
```

With this in place there's just one final step we need to take so that we can visualize our routes. We need to transform our list of IDs into routes. We will define another function that takes two sites and calculates the shortest path between them and iterates throughout the full list of IDs:

```python
def ortoolToOsmnxRoute(data, G, rtoolSolution, oxmnxNodes, weight='length'):
    SOL_ROUTES = []
    for j in range(data["num_vehicles"]):
        rtes = [
            ox.shortest_path(
                G, 
                oxmnxNodes[rtoolSolution[j][i]], 
                oxmnxNodes[rtoolSolution[j][i+1]], 
                weight=weight
            )
            for i in range(len(rtoolSolution[j])-1)
        ]
        SOL_ROUTES.append(rtes)
    return SOL_ROUTES
```

We are now ready to get our routes in a form that [OSMnx](https://osmnx.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) can handle and plot!

```python
SOL_ROUTES = ortoolToOsmnxRoute(data, G, OSOL, nNodes),
```

## Visualizing Routes

I won't go through the whole code on creating our map, but the whole code is available [here](https://github.com/Chipdelmal/MGSurvE_DA/blob/main/Africa/TZA/lndRoads.py#L186); where the main parts are:

```python
# Generate (fig, ax) tuple ----------------------------------------------------
(fig, ax) = (
    plt.figure(figsize=FIG_SIZE, facecolor=STYLE_BG['color']), 
    plt.axes(projection=PROJ)
)
# Roads network and buildings footprints --------------------------------------
(fig, ax) = ox.plot_graph(
    G, ax, node_size=0, figsize=(40, 40), show=False,
    bgcolor=STYLE_BG['color'], edge_color=STYLE_RD['color'], 
    edge_alpha=STYLE_RD['alpha'], edge_linewidth=STYLE_RD['width']
)
(fig, ax) = ox.plot_footprints(
    BLD, ax=ax, save=False, show=False, close=False,
    bgcolor=STYLE_BG['color'], color=STYLE_BD['color'], 
    alpha=STYLE_BD['alpha']
)
# Sites -----------------------------------------------------------------------
lnd.plotTraps(
    fig, ax, 
    size=250, transparencyHex='CC',
    zorders=(30, 25), proj=PROJ
)
# Routes ----------------------------------------------------------------------
for (ix, vehicle) in enumerate(SOL_ROUTES):
    for route in vehicle:
        (fig, ax) = ox.plot_graph_route(
            G, route, ax=ax, save=False, show=False, close=False,
            route_color=cst.RCOLORS[ix], route_linewidth=5, 
            node_size=0, node_alpha=0, bgcolor='#00000000', 
            route_alpha=0.6
        )
# Geofeatures -----------------------------------------------------------------
lnd.plotLandBoundary(
    fig, ax,  
    landTuples=(('10m', '#dfe7fd99', 30), ('10m', '#ffffffDD', 5))
)
ax = WTR.plot(ax=ax, fc='#3C78BB77', markersize=0)
```

# Future Work

This is only the first towards our final application, as this codebase optimizes the route after the traps have been optimized. For our research product we need to incorporate this routing into our genetic algorithm itself but even as it is right now, this code could be used to provide information to field teams to make the best of their vehicular resources!
