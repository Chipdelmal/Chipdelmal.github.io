A 3 day data-visualization bootcamp that I designed for professors in my *alma mater*, [Tecnol√≥gico de Monterrey](https://tec.mx/es/estado-de-mexico).

<!--more-->

# Introduction

I was hired to teach a data visualization bootcamp on my former university using the programming languages: [Mathematica](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/), [R](https://www.r-project.org/), and [Python](https://www.python.org/). This was a bit challenging because, even though I am reasonably proficient with the three languages, I tend to prefer [Mathematica](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/) and [Python](https://www.python.org/) over [R](https://www.r-project.org/); and jumping from one language to the other on the fly was a bit confusing sometimes.

## Objective

The main objective of the course was to provide datasets and exercises on a wide array of data visualization techniques for course-takers to develop some of the basic skills required to transform and visualize data into meaningful plots. This was not an in-depth course, as it was aimed at participants with different backgrounds and skillsets (from humanities to engineering and computer science); and as such, it was geared towards having the audience take code snippets, put them together and customize them so that they could start developing a sense on which kinds of datasets tend to be better represented by a given plot type.

## Content

In addition to over [20 plotting coding exercises](#topics-and-exercises), the course covered these subjects: [image formats](https://github.com/Chipdelmal/dataViz_CADi/blob/master/markdowns/formats.md), [data formats and sources](https://github.com/Chipdelmal/dataViz_CADi/blob/master/markdowns/dataHandlingAndDataSources.md), [python and anaconda](https://github.com/Chipdelmal/dataViz_CADi/blob/master/markdowns/pythonAndAnaconda.md), [color palettes](https://github.com/Chipdelmal/dataViz_CADi/blob/master/markdowns/colors.md), [dataviz good practices](https://github.com/Chipdelmal/dataViz_CADi/blob/master/markdowns/goodPractices.md), [github](https://github.com/Chipdelmal/dataViz_CADi/blob/master/markdowns/github.md), [markdown and HTML](https://github.com/Chipdelmal/dataViz_CADi/blob/master/markdowns/markdown.md), [github-pages](https://github.com/Chipdelmal/dataViz_CADi/blob/master/markdowns/ghPages.md), [ffmpeg](https://github.com/Chipdelmal/dataViz_CADi/blob/master/markdowns/ffmpeg.md). In which the participants alternated between doing exercises and listening to explanations with tips and tricks to convey information more efficiently. This helped keep the bootcamp dynamic, as sessions were 8 hours long, which made it challenging to keep engagement and energies high.



# Select Exercises


## NFL Players Size

I like NFL, so when I got a hold of a CSV file with player's stats, I decided to use it for one of the exercises. The idea in these panels is to compare the player's weight and height across the different groups of player positions.

## 1984 Wordcloud and Treemap

To exemplify some ways to do frequency-based representations of data, we did an exercise with the text of my favorite book "1984" by George Orwell.

## Cities

We did some spatial data exercises, including an interactive globe with the largest cities in the world, and a map of the largest cities in the US:
