One of the first collaborations with my current PI, [John Marshall](https://www.marshalllab.com/) involved the analysis of a dataset in the movement of people in Sub-Saharan Africa. This dataset contained survey data on human movement in the countries of Zambia, Tanzania, Burkina Faso, and Mali; and was used to fit gravity and radiation models to try and characterize the way people move in these locations.

# Description

The full description of the dataset can be found in the [methods section](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26023-1#Sec2) of the publication, but in general, people were surveyed to know about their travel history. With the information about their sources-destinations, we were able to generate movement matrices between the cities within their countries. To visualize these data, we clustered the sources by the frequency of their connections (colors), and we plotted the trips frequencies as thin lines between cities.

After doing these analyses, we fitted both gravity and radiation models to the data. The full description of the work can be found in our [publication](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/325171555_Mathematical_models_of_human_mobility_of_relevance_to_malaria_transmission_in_Africa).
