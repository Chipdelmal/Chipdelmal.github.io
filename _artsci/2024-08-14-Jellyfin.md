<!--Necessary steps and issues with setting up a jellyfin media center on MacOS using docker.-->

<!--more-->

# Intro

I've been using [jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org/) to host my own local media center so that I can watch series, movies, and listen to music on all of my devices. I was doing this by using an old [Mac from 2013](https://support.apple.com/en-us/111946) but unfortunately it got too old to update to any supported version that is compatible with the one running on my [Firestick](https://www.amazon.com/fire-tv-stick-with-3rd-gen-alexa-voice-remote/dp/B08C1W5N87), so I was forced to upgrade it to a more recent computer I had laying around. This ended up being a bit more complicated than I expected as the native application files available in the Jellyfin website kept giving me errors, so I just decided to use its Docker version, which was a bit of an adventure due to slight differences between Linux and MacOS (and the way they handle drives and permissions). This post is based and adapted from ["How to run Jellyfin within a Docker Container"](https://pimylifeup.com/jellyfin-docker/"), which is meant to be used to setup the server on [Linux](https://ubuntu.com/).

## Materials

Strictly speaking, only a Mac computer that can get [Docker installed](https://www.docker.com/) and an internet connection, but an external HDD is strongly recommended to store all the media.

### Computer

I'm using a 2017 [13-inch MacBook Pro](https://support.apple.com/en-us/111951) running on [Ventura 13.6.9](https://support.apple.com/en-us/106337) for this setup.

### External Drive

I decided to buy a dedicated HDD for this project and went with the [Avolusion PRO-5Y Series](https://www.amazon.com/Avolusion-PRO-5Y-External-WindowsOS-Desktop/dp/B0CJM1B6DY) but any external or internal drive should work for these purposes, we just need to make sure to map the locations to our running [docker container](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container/). In my case, I've named my disk `Samus` and it mounts on the following location in the system `/Volumes/Samus/`. In this drive, I have created three different folders for my media types:

```zsh
/Volumes/Samus/TV
/Volumes/Samus/Music
/Volumes/Samus/Movies
```

so these are the paths I will be mapping to my docker media center (and will need to be replaced for other users).

### Installing Docker

Finally, we need to install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/) in our system. This is pretty straightforward, as we only need to go to their website and download the [DMG](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/) that matches our OS. The version used in this example is [4.33.0](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/release-notes/), with the `27.1.1` engine.

## Docker Server

### Setting Directories Up

We will need two folders to be created in our computer, so that we can map them to the docker instance:

```zsh
sudo mkdir -p ~/jellyfin/cache
sudo mkdir -p ~/jellyfin/config
```

These folders can be anywhere in our system, we just need to keep track of them for the setup. This next step might not be necessary but it ensures that we have ownership of the created folders:

```zsh
sudo chown $USER: ~/jellyfin/cache 
sudo chown $USER: ~/jellyfin/config
```


### Docker Compose

Now, the easiest way to map the folders and ports necessary to run our server is by creating a [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) file. This can be done either with a plain text editor, an IDE, or directly in the terminal. For this guide, we will follow the terminal route by using [nano](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Nano):

```zsh
cd jellyfin
sudo nano docker-compose.yml
```

And adding the following contents:

```yml
services:
  jellyfin:
    image: jellyfin/jellyfin
    container_name: jellyfin
    ports:
      - 8096:8096
    volumes:
      - ~/jellyfin/config:/config
      - ~/jellyfin/cache:/cache
      - type: bind
        source: /Volumes/Samus/Movies
        target: /movies
      - type: bind
        source: /Volumes/Samus/Music
        target: /music
      - type: bind
        source: /Volumes/Samus/TV
        target: /tv
    restart: 'unless-stopped'
```

If you are following this guide, feel free to copy and paste, but remember to change the `/Volumes/Samus/` path to the specific location where you are setting up your media.

One note. In contrast to how it is setup in Linux, I had to remove the following line that is commonly stated in guides for Ubuntu, as it would cause problems with accessing the server even locally:

```yml
network_mode: 'host'
```

### Drive Permissions

Compared to the [Linux setup guide](https://pimylifeup.com/jellyfin-docker/), in MacOS we need to manually give permission to the docker container to access the `media`, `config`, and `cache` folders by opening [Docker's](https://www.docker.com/) preferences, going to `Resources/File Sharing`, and adding them to the `Virtual file shares`:

Additionally, I had to change from [VirtioFS to gRPC Fuse](https://www.docker.com/blog/deep-dive-into-new-docker-desktop-filesharing-implementation/), as I was getting drive access errors when I first booted up my media center:

<center><img src="/media/jellyfin/gfuse.png" style="width:100%;"></center>

With these settings in place, we are ready to launch our [jellyfin server](https://jellyfin.org/).

### Launching

To run the server, just navigate to the folder where you created the `docker-compose` file, and run the following command:

```zsh
docker compose up
```

Or, alternatively, to run it in [detached](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/compose/up/) mode:

```zsh
docker compose up -d
```

Now, let's wait for a couple of seconds for docker to setup the [jellyfin container](https://jellyfin.org/docs/general/installation/container/) up.

### Accessing Locally

Once the server has launched, let's access it in the same computer by opening `http://localhost:8096` in any internet browser.

### Accessing in Network

To open our server from a different device in the same network, we first need to figure out our system's [IP Address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address), something we can do by running: `ifconfig | grep "inet " | grep -Fv 127.0.0.1 | awk '{print $2}'`; which, in my case, is: `192.168.1.175`. So, to open my media center, I'd just need to open `http://192.168.1.175:9999` in any device on my network.

### Creating Alias

As a final step, I decided to create an [zsh alias](https://dev.to/haamid/how-to-define-custom-alias-in-zsh-3b6a) to launch my server easily when booting my computer. This can be done by opening the [zshrc file](https://mac.install.guide/terminal/zshrc-zprofile) with `nano ~/.zshrc`, adding the following line:

```zsh
alias jelly="cd ~/jellyfin; docker compose up"
```

and then re-sourcing it with `source ~/.zshrc`.

## Wrap-Up

In general, the process to setup the server in MacOS with docker is relatively straightforward and very similar to the one followed in Linux but some of the network and permissions settings are different, so they need a couple of tweaks in the [docker-compose](#docker-compose) file and [docker drive permissions](#drive-permissions). Finally, I won't go into details on how to setup the server once it has launched and accessed correctly, as its wizard is pretty easy to follow, but for more information on these, and other steps, please have a look at the following [sources section](#Sources) of this document.
