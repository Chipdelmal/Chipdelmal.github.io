Doing Pop Art with Machine Learning artstyle transfer.

<!--more-->

Some time ago I ran across a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1508.06576.pdf) describing the machine-learning application of transferring the art-style from a painting into another image. [Mathematica v12](https://www.wolfram.com/language/12/machine-learning-for-images/style-transfer-for-creative-art.html?product=mathematica) includes a built-in command to do this in a single line of code, so I started using it to explore ideas until I had something I liked, which ended up being a "Pop-Art" Machine Learning application for photos.
