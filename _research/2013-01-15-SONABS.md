[SoNA3BS](https://github.com/Chipdelmal/SoNA3BS) (Social Networks Aedes aegypti Agent-Based Simulation) was a [NetLogo](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/) simulation developed to understand and teach about the community effects of mosquito-transmitted diseases through the use of network theory.

# Intro

This project is the main subject on my PhD thesis (under [Edgar Vallejo's](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Edgar-Vallejo) supervision). It was my first contact with mosquito-transmitted diseases and the mathematical modeling of epidemiological processes.
In creating this simulation, I had the chance to learn about the processes that

## Hypothesis and Objectives

The broader thesis hypothesis was: _The creation and use of an agent-based framework in conjunction with network theory analytical tools can provide epidemiological insight on how the spatial relations of human-mosquito interactions affect the potential spread of Aedes aegypti-transmitted diseases._

Which was narrowed down into more digestible research-questions through the following sub-hypotheses:

* Sub-hypothesis 1: _A computational agent-based model that adheres to existing knowledge of Aedes aegypti biology can be created and run in reasonable computational times on general purpose computers (on the order of days)._
* Sub-hypothesis 2: _The model’s adults mosquito population dynamics matches an independently-created model’s number of adult females within the range of 15oC to 32.5oC temperatures and up to 20 breeding sites within an error rate of 1.5._
* Sub-hypothesis 3: _The model can reconstruct the emergent vectorial-contact networks generated by mosquito bites upon humans, and these networks provide useful insight into the differences in epidemiological processes on different spatial layouts._

# Features

Other simulations and models already existed when I coded [SoNA3BS](https://github.com/Chipdelmal/SoNA3BS), but some of the factors that differentiates this model from others at that point in time were the following.

## Biological

* Mosquitos go through their 4 life stages: egg, larva, pupa, adult
* Stage lengths are temperature-dependent (through Schooldfield's metabolic rates)
* Population is tracked at an individual level
* Directed flight is implemented (mosquitos move in a resource-based manner)
* Temperature-dependent mortality rates
* Male and female individuals and life-cycles

## Epidemiological and Vector Control

* RIDL, ovitraps, fogging, sugar baits, and Wolbachia mosquito-control interventions are implemented
* Bites' information is stored for network analysis
* Human behavior can be tweaked to analyze contributing factors to disease transmission, such as movement

## Computational 

* Fully documented code
* ABM is easy to use and extend as it is coded in [NetLogo](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/)
* Sims information is stored in XML format for easy analysis
* State-machine structure for the agents

# Methods and Findings

Our work's results were divided in validation and experiments' analysis sections. Here, we show some of the highlights but please refer to the [thesis document](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/316794649_SoNA3BS_An_Agent-Based_Model_to_Study_High-Resolution_Spatial_Heterogeneity_in_Aedes_aegypti-Borne_Diseases_Through_the_Use_of_Network_Theory) for details.

## ABM vs ODE

[SoNA3BS](https://github.com/Chipdelmal/SoNA3BS) was validated against a deterministic version of [Otero's](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16832731/) model. We tested our ABM within a range of breeding sites and temperatures defined in the scope of our work.

  });

## Networks

With the model validated for the operational ranges we defined in our scope, we did some vectorial networks analysis to show how bites' heterogeneity can emerge from simple human-mosquito interactions.
