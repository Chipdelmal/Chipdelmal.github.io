MoNeT (Mosquito Networks Taskforce) was born in efforts to come up with standardized methods to understand and analyze complex spatial mosquito behavior.

# Intro

This project was initially created to analyze the spatial response of genetic constructs to control mosquito-borne diseases. Over time, however, it became clear that it could respond to a wider array of needs in the field.
As such, it was branched out as a playground in which I could develop applications with help of a series of undergrad students looking for research experience.

The common underlying theme amongst all of these application branches is: mosquito heterogeneity and its impact in genetic constructs dispersal.

# Branches

## Data Analysis Pipelines

Arguably the main line of work in the MoNeT project is the creation of data analysis pipelines that couple to [MGDrivE's](./2017-07-01-MGDrivE.html) simulation outputs.
Through these lines of work, MoNeT provides all the backbone necessary to process extremely large amounts of data to produce useful insights on the spatiotemporal components of mosquito gene drive technologies.
