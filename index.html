I'm a Computer Scientist PhD with a Mechatronics Engineer BSc working in modeling processes related to the spread/control of mosquito-borne diseases. My main lines of research focus on simulating the spatial spread of gene-drives in mosquito populations, and modeling the effects of mosquito-control interventions in mathematical/computational frameworks. I am particularly interested in the application of CS/Engineering methodologies (network theory, optimization techniques, individual-based modeling, etcetera) to stop the spread of vector-borne diseases. In the past I've worked in animal vocalizations analysis, robotics, computer vision, electronics instrumentation and automotive industry.
For a list of my scientific publications please take a look at my <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Hector-Sanchez-Castellanos">ResearchGate profile</a>.
